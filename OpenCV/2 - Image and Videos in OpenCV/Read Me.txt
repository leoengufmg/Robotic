A - Deep Learning OpenCV
originally written in c++, and when used with Python, The OpenCV Array Structures are converted to and from NumPy Array

	C++			Python
	OpenCV Array		NumPy Array

Numpy contain:
	. powerful N-dimensional array objects
	. sophisticate broadcasting fuctions
	. tools for integrating C, C++ and Fortran code (processing images faster)
	. Mathematical capabilities: Linear algebra, Fourier Transforms, tandom number capabilities

Numpy object is multidimendional array, its a table of elements, usually numbers, indexed by a tuple of positive intergers
Evey Numpy provides a large set of numeric data types, and every NumPy array is a grid of elements of the same type.


B - Understand Images

Grayscale camera record the intensity of reflected of light
	BLACK				WHITE
	0	---------------------	255

Color Camera si a number of each of RGB scale
	RED	GREEN	BLUE
	0	  0	  0
	255	 255	 255

Color is a mixture of lights of different wavelengths. 

When use OpenCV, its use BGR system color so:
	RGB: (200, 72, 159)
	BGR: (159, 72, 200)
