   Experience on Deep Learning, a branch of Artificial Intelligence (IA),  finding patterns and insights in data, including images and video, and using layering and abstraction give deep learning models almost human-like abilitiesâ€”including advanced image recognition. The tools that I use is the computer vision software OpenCV that give and advantage of run previously trained deep learning models on inexpensive hardware and generate powerful insights from digital images and video. Also experience to provide classification for both images and videos, use blobs and leverage YOLOv3 for custom object detection.
